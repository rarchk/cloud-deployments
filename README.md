# Cloud Deployments

> Journey of application from development box to production... 


In this repo, I explore a random application running on a software developer machine, and try to run it in production using tools like 

0. Build an application using programming language (Java)
1. Containerize your application  (Docker) 
2. Scheduling and Fault Tolerant Deployment (Docker Swarm and Kubernetes)
3. Orchestrate the development enviroment using tools (Ansible, Terraform)
4. Adding Software Processes to update application (CI/CD Pipeline)
